# If you're reading this, you're probably reading either:
#  /etc/wicd/dhclient.conf.template.default
# or
#  /etc/wicd/dhclient.conf.template
# or
#  a generated dhclient configuration in /var/run
# (these files could be in different locations, as determined by your
# packager or system administrator, but those are the default pathes)
#
# Here's what you need to know:
#  The .default file is copied by wicd to dhclient.conf.template if
#  dhclient.conf.template does not exist. If dhclient.conf.template
#  does exist, the .default file is not used. This is to allow
#  upgrades of the package without destroying user changes.
#
#  In other words, if you want to change the generated dhclient
#  configuration, you need to change dhclient.conf.template,
#  NOT dhclient.conf.template.default

# wicd will replace $_HOSTNAME in the following line with
# the appropriate hostname for this system
send host-name "$_HOSTNAME";
send dhcp-lease-time 7260;
