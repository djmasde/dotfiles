/*
 * BOPM Example Configuration for UnrealIRCd by Stealth <stealth@x-tab.org>
 *
 * This is an EXAMPLE configuration file for BOPM. This is NOT a working
 * configuration, and should NOT be assumed or treated as such. This file is
 * meant to be used as a guide in the hopes it will be useful to someone 
 * learning how to configure BOPM for UnrealIRCd.
 *
 * I have only included directives that are REQUIRED for BOPM to function. I
 * intentionally put bad values in places and commented lines required for
 * BOPM to operate.
 *
 * DO NOT EMAIL ME FOR HELP WITH BOPM
 * IRC support may be obtained on irc.unrealircd.org in #BOPM
